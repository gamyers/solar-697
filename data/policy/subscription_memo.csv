However, Entergy Louisiana has determined that until the PSC approves a successor net metering tariff, effective January 1, 2016, the company will continue to interconnect solar PV systems under an alternative billing arrangement, that includes a single meter with two channels - channel 1 will record the electricity consumed by the home net of any usage met by the customer’s solar system, and channel 2 will record the excess electricity produced by the system that is delivered to the grid. Customers will continue to receive credit for instantaneous self-generation and usage. The electricity consumed as recorded on channel 1 will be billed at the applicable retail rate, while any excess electricity delivered to the grid as recorded on channel 2 will be credited on the customer’s bill at Entergy Louisiana’s avoided cost adjusted for avoided line losses and daytime production. Customers who have interconnected or submitted a completed application for interconnection by December 31, 2015 will not be affected by this new billing arrangement. Entergy Louisiana has updated its net metering website to provide consumers and solar installers with additional information"
